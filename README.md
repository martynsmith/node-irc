NodeJS IRC client library
=========================

How to get it
-------------

The easiest way to get it is via [npm][]

    npm install irc

If you want to run the latest version (i.e. later than the version available
via [npm][]) you can clone this repo, then use [npm][] to link-install it:

    npm link /path/to/your/clone

Of course, you can just clone this, and manually point at the library itself,
but I really recommend using [npm][]!

How to use it
-------------

This library provides basic IRC client functionality. In the simplest case you
can connect to an IRC server like so:

    var irc = require('irc');
    var client = new irc.Client('irc.dollyfish.net.nz', 'myNick', {
        channels: ['#blah'],
    });

Of course it's not much use once it's connected if that's all you have!

The client emits a large number of events that correlate to things you'd
normally see in your favourite IRC client. Most likely the first one you'll
want to use is:

    client.addListener('message', function (from, to, message) {
        console.log(from + ' => ' + to + ': ' + message);
    });

or if you're only interested in messages to the bot itself:

    client.addListener('pm', function (from, message) {
        console.log(from + ' => ME: ' + message);
    });

or to a particular channel:

    client.addListener('message#yourchannel', function (from, message) {
        console.log(from + ' => #yourchannel: ' + message);
    });

At the moment there are functions for joining:

    client.join('#yourchannel');

parting:

    client.part('#yourchannel');

talking:

    client.say('#yourchannel', "I'm a bot!");
    client.say('nonbeliever', "SRSLY, I AM!");

and sending notices:

    client.notice('#yourchannel', "I'm a bot!");
    client.notice('nonbeliever', "SRSLY, I AM!");

You can also whois people:

    client.whois('Human');

It returns something like this:

    { nickname: 'John',
      username: 'jdoe',
      host: 'host.net',
      realname: 'John Doe',
      channels: [ '#hatcollectors' ],
      auth: null }

For any other commands you might want to send to the server you can use the
send() message which sends raw messages to the server:

    client.send('MODE', '#yourchannel', '+o', 'yournick');

All commands and events are documented in `API.md` (hopefully). I hope to make
a more complete set of events/commands over the next few weeks.
