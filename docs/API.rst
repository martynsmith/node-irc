This library provides IRC client functionality

Client
----------

.. js:function:: irc.Client(server, nick [, options])

    This object is the base of everything, it represents a single nick connected to
    a single IRC server.

    The first two arguments are the server to connect to, and the nickname to
    attempt to use. The third optional argument is an options object with default
    values::

        {
            userName: 'nodebot',
            realName: 'nodeJS IRC client',
            port: 6667,
            debug: false,
            showErrors: false,
            autoRejoin: true,
            autoConnect: true,
            channels: [],
            secure: false,
            selfSigned: false,
            floodProtection: false
        }

    `secure` (SSL connection) can be a true value or an object (the kind of object
    returned from `crypto.createCredentials()`) specifying cert etc for validation.
    If you set `selfSigned` to true SSL accepts certificates from a non trusted CA.

    `floodProtection` queues all your messages and slowly unpacks it to make sure
    that we won't get kicked out because for Excess Flood.

    Setting `autoConnect` to false prevents the Client from connecting on
    instantiation.  You will need to call `connect()` on the client instance::

        var client = new irc.Client({ autoConnect: false, ... });
        client.connect();


.. js:function:: Client.send(command, arg1, arg2, ...)

    Sends a raw message to the server, generally speaking it's best not to use
    this method unless you know what you're doing, instead use one of the
    methods below.

.. js:function:: Client.join(channel, callback)

    Joins the specified channel.

    :param string channel: Channel to join
    :param function callback: Callback to automatically subscribed to the
        `join#channel` event, but removed after the first invocation.

.. js:function:: Client.part(channel, callback)

    Parts the specified channel.

    :param string channel: Channel to part
    :param function callback: Callback to automatically subscribed to the
        `part#channel` event, but removed after the first invocation.

.. js:function:: Client.say(target, message)

    Sends a message to the specified target.

    :param string target: is either a nickname, or a channel.
    :param string message: the message to send to the target.

.. js:function:: Client.notice(target, message)

    Sends a notice to the specified target.

    :param string target: is either a nickname, or a channel.
    :param string message: the message to send as a notice to the target.

.. js:function:: Client.whois(nick, callback)

    Request a whois for the specified `nick`.

    :param string nick: is a nickname
    :param function callback: Callback to fire when the server has finished
        generating the whois information and is passed exactly the same
        information as a `whois` event described above.


.. js:function:: Client.disconnect(message)

    Disconnects from the IRC server.

    :param string message: Message to send when disconnecting.

    channel).

.. js:data:: 'join#channel'

    `function (nick) { }`

    means that the notice comes from the server.
