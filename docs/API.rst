This library provides IRC client functionality

Client
----------

.. js:function:: irc.Client(server, nick [, options])

    This object is the base of everything, it represents a single nick connected to
    a single IRC server.

    The first two arguments are the server to connect to, and the nickname to
    attempt to use. The third optional argument is an options object with default
    values::

        {
            userName: 'nodebot',
            realName: 'nodeJS IRC client',
            port: 6667,
            debug: false,
            showErrors: false,
            autoRejoin: true,
            autoConnect: true,
            channels: [],
            secure: false,
            selfSigned: false,
            certExpired: false,
            floodProtection: false,
            floodProtectionDelay: 1000,
            stripColors: false
        }

    `secure` (SSL connection) can be a true value or an object (the kind of object
    returned from `crypto.createCredentials()`) specifying cert etc for validation.
    If you set `selfSigned` to true SSL accepts certificates from a non trusted CA.
    If you set `certExpired` to true, the bot connects even if the ssl cert has expired.

    `floodProtection` queues all your messages and slowly unpacks it to make sure
    that we won't get kicked out because for Excess Flood. You can also use
    `Client.activateFloodProtection()` to activate flood protection after
    instantiating the client.

    `floodProtectionDelay` sets the amount of time that the client will wait
    between sending subsequent messages when `floodProtection` is enabled.

    `stripColors` removes mirc colors (0x03 followed by one or two ascii
    numbers for foreground,background) and ircII "effect" codes (0x02
    bold, 0x1f underline, 0x16 reverse, 0x0f reset) from the entire
    message before parsing it and passing it along.

    Setting `autoConnect` to false prevents the Client from connecting on
    instantiation.  You will need to call `connect()` on the client instance::

        var client = new irc.Client({ autoConnect: false, ... });
        client.connect();


.. js:function:: Client.send(command, arg1, arg2, ...)

    Sends a raw message to the server; generally speaking, it's best not to use
    this method unless you know what you're doing. Instead, use one of the
    methods below.

.. js:function:: Client.join(channel, callback)

    Joins the specified channel.

    :param string channel: Channel to join
    :param function callback: Callback to automatically subscribed to the
        `join#channel` event, but removed after the first invocation.  `channel`
        supports multiple JOIN arguments as a space separated string (similar to
        the IRC protocol).

.. js:function:: Client.part(channel, callback)

    Parts the specified channel.

    :param string channel: Channel to part
    :param function callback: Callback to automatically subscribed to the
        `part#channel` event, but removed after the first invocation.

.. js:function:: Client.say(target, message)

    Sends a message to the specified target.

    :param string target: is either a nickname, or a channel.
    :param string message: the message to send to the target.

.. js:function:: Client.ctcp(target, type, text)

    Sends a CTCP message to the specified target.
    
    :param string target: is either a nickname, or a channel.
    :param string type: the type of the CTCP message, either "privmsg" for
        a PRIVMSG or something else for a NOTICE.
    :param string text: the CTCP message to send.

.. js:function:: Client.action(target, message)

    Sends an action to the specified target.

.. js:function:: Client.notice(target, message)

    Sends a notice to the specified target.

    :param string target: is either a nickname, or a channel.
    :param string message: the message to send as a notice to the target.

.. js:function:: Client.whois(nick, callback)

    Request a whois for the specified `nick`.

    :param string nick: is a nickname
    :param function callback: Callback to fire when the server has finished
        generating the whois information and is passed exactly the same
        information as a `whois` event described above.

.. js:function:: Client.list([arg1, arg2, ...])

   Request a channel listing from the server. The arguments for this method are
   fairly server specific, this method just passes them through exactly as
   specified.

   Responses from the server are available via the `channellist_start`,
   `channellist_item`, and `channellist` events.

.. js:function:: Client.connect(retryCount, callback)

   Connects to the server. Used when `autoConnect` in the options is set to
   false. If `retryCount` is a function it will be treated as the `callback`
   (i.e. both arguments to this function are optional).

    :param integer retryCount: Optional number of times to attempt reconnection
    :param function callback: Optional callback

.. js:function:: Client.disconnect(message, callback)

    Disconnects from the IRC server. If `message` if a function it will be
    treated as the `callback` (i.e. both arguments to this function are
    optional).

    :param string message: Optional message to send when disconnecting.
    :param function callback: Optional callback

.. js:function:: Client.activateFloodProtection(interval)

    Activates flood protection "after the fact". You can also use
    `floodProtection` while instantiating the Client to enable flood
    protection, and `floodProtectionDelay` to set the default message
    interval.

    :param integer interval: Optional configuration for amount of time
        to wait between messages. Takes value from client configuration
        if unspecified.
